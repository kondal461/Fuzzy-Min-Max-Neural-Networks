# Fuzzy-Min-Max-Neural-Networks
Hyperbox classifier for pattern recognition
This is a matlab code for research article: A Fuzzy Min-Max Neural Network Classifier With Compensatory Neuron Architecture
The original research acrticle can be found at: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4049831
FMCN_main file is the main programme file that calls other fuctions.
I have provided the two datasets in .mat format.
Feel free to change if any errors as I have implemented it with my little knowledge in matlab.
